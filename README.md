# Docker compose templates
I create this repo to store sample docker-compose.yml file for quickly deploy some common services.

## How to use
1. First you need to install latest version of docker. Following docker's installation guideline: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
2. Find the service you need, get into it and deploy

```
cd mysql
docker compose up -d --build
```
